ku...
so this is the end
you know..?
I wouldn't be here,
if beat didn't decide to create this game for you.
There was one day, Beat notice that you do something to celebrate to your girlfriend.
Then Beat just decide to do something for your birthday,
Beat's idea was to create a video game to mock you for not playing csgo with squad but spends time with girlfriend instead.
After he got the idea, his daily routine is to wake up then continue creating this game.
Beat looks so much happier.
It's like he has something to live for.
The hard part is that he had to keep this secret from you.
He really really wanted to tell you about this.
Well, Beat always tells you everything.
but this one he cannot.
He couldn't hold it in so he told you that he can't tell you.
you have to wait around 2 months.
Beat loves you to much!!!
I wish you can just pay a little more attention to Beat!!!
You can just say "good moring" to him.
That would already made his day.
...
:)
It's time for me to go.
I love you too Dew. Even though, I'm just Beat's imaginary character.
